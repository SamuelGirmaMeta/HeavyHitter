# RoboWitch Clash  

**Team Members:** Samuel Girma

**How would you pitch your game in one line?**  
"It's like *Mega Man* meets *Dark Souls* but with customizable robots battling magical witches in a post-apocalyptic world."  

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**  
The core mechanic is **modular robot customization**. Players can swap out parts like arms, legs, and weapons to adapt to different witches and their unique magical abilities. For example:  
- **Flamethrower Arm:** Effective against ice witches but vulnerable to water-based attacks.  
- **Shield Module:** Blocks magical projectiles but slows movement.  
- **Jet Legs:** Allows dodging and aerial attacks but reduces defense.  

This mechanic is fun because it encourages strategic thinking and experimentation, as players must analyze each witch's strengths and weaknesses to build the perfect robot for the fight.  

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**  
1. **Prepare:** Players customize their robot in the workshop, choosing parts and abilities based on the next witch's known powers.  
2. **Fight:** Enter the battlefield and engage in fast-paced, skill-based combat. Players must dodge spells, exploit weaknesses, and manage their robot's energy levels.  
3. **Loot:** Defeating a witch rewards players with new parts, blueprints, or resources to upgrade their robot.  
4. **Repeat:** Use the loot to improve the robot and take on stronger witches with more complex abilities.  

Challenges include learning attack patterns, managing limited energy for attacks and movement, and adapting to unexpected witch abilities. Rewards include new parts, cosmetic upgrades, and story progression.  

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**  
- **Progression:** Players unlock new robot parts and abilities as they defeat witches, creating a sense of growth and discovery.  
- **Variety:** Each witch has unique attack patterns and weaknesses, requiring players to rethink their strategy and robot build.  
- **Boss Fights:** Epic, multi-phase battles with witches that escalate in difficulty and spectacle.  
- **Short Play Sessions:** Levels are designed to be completed in 5-10 minutes, making it easy to jump in and out while still feeling rewarding.  

The general scope is a single-player action game with 5-7 unique witches, each with their own arena and mechanics, and a wide variety of robot parts to unlock and experiment with.
